#   ECE564_HW 
This is the project you will use for all four of your ECE564 homework assignments. You need to download to your computer, add your code, and then add a repo under your own ID with this name ("ECE564_HW"). It is important that you use the same project name.  Any notes, additional functions, comments you want to share with the TA and I before grading please put in this file in the correspondiing section below.  Part of the grading is anything you did above and beyond the requirements, so make sure that is included here in the README.

## HW1

In Gender, DukeRole, and DukeProgram, because Swift implicitly assumes the case to be a string of itself if the enum is of type String, I got rid of the redundant strings.

I also placed Gender under the Person class, as this enumeration applies to all Person objects, and I placed DukeRole and DukeProgram under the DukePerson class, as these enumerations will only apply to Duke People. 

I also opted to store, modify, and delete data entries using the CoreData framework both to make my creation more practical and to get some practice using CoreData.
